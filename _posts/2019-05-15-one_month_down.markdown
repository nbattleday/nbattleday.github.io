One moment I thought it all made sense and then I hit a wall.  I now know that I need to immerse myself into the Slack community more and join a study group on the regular.  I have had some life circumstances pop up unexpectedly and learned fast that not diving into the content each and every night can quickly put me behind.  Instead of feeling frustrated and defeated I try to keep reminding myself that this is indeed self paced because on top of 40+ hours of work each week life is going to keep happening.  So my advise to others thus far is "just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming swimming swimming"!  We're all going to hit a road block along this path - we just have to keep soaking it all in and using our resources, while staying positive because this ain't gonna be easy!
